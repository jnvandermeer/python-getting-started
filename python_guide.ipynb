    "## 1. On Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to use python for neurostimulation, we should install python on the computer first. Most computers already have some version of python, but this is for our purposes totally unacceptable. Tampering with that usually will break your system. The only recommended way to use python is therefore in a safe, disposable sandbox environment in which you can screw up as badly as possible with impunity without ever inavertently adversly affecting the rest of your computer even in the slightest. Think of the installation and use of this sandbox environment as installing and running Matlab.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a **Virtual Environment**. The name is indeed a little 'virtual', and to me that strikes as 'vague', but its purpose is clear: containing your python installation and associated packages for a specfic application. Each environment has a specific **name** that you give to it. For example a stimulus presentation environment might be called *st*, while an analysis environment might be called *eeganalysis*. The nice thing is that you can install different python packages of different versions in your different environments without affecting each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are in the python world several virual environment softwares:\n",
    " - pipenv\n",
    " - virtualenv\n",

    "This seems a bit mind-boggling (to me it was anyway), and this is what you get in the open-source community: Lots of different people work on overcoming an (often occurring!) problem with different kinds of ideas and coming from their own situations, and thereby come up with lots of different solutions. There is only ONE solution to use for our purposes, and you can forget all the rest. I did mention them because you will definitely run into them as you go along. The only one really good solution (and that you must use) is **miniconda**. A short word about conda, miniconda and anaconda. **conda** is the *actual* Software, whereas miniconda and anaconda are more descriptive of the repositories of python packages shipped in the download. Miniconda is the best because it comes with less bulk. Anaconda also as a GUI which is a bit too slow for my tastes.\n",

    "Regarding Psychopy, it is a good idea to just explore (and use) the builder for the simple stuff - you don't have to know any python, just how to navigate the builder. But, then you don't immediately know what all the key components are of psychopy (window, event, visualm etc) and how to call them. The Builder produces a `playmovie_last_run.py` (along with a `.psyexp`, which is some XML coding for the options in the builder) python script that can be run also exactly as per the 4 steps described above. This looks more complicated but at a basic level works highly similar to what we just made. The one thing we haven't touched is triggers and logging. Those would also be lines that are written at the correct places within the main script. For the moviestim, you might wish to still use the builder to make it, and compare the two .py output files.\n",
